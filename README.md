# Personal README

### What is this all about?

- Just like any `README` file, this is an easy way to answer questions that you may have regarding how I work and collaborate with you. 
- Having a document like this helps me clarify my ideas and values and communicate them. 
- Having a document like this also allows any collaborator, partner or team member that I work with to hold me to my own standards in a safe and non-confrontational way.
- Keep in mind though, I'm a human, and some of this may change as I grow and develop myself.

### How I view success
- I believe learning agility is essential to success and that success is an output of how well someone can duck-and-dive in opaque or unclear situations.
- There are three important levers for success in a leadership role: People, Purpose and Process. 
- Therefore, success is having the right people in the right roles working with clarity on important and valuable things in the right way, while defining, measuring and adjusting what "right," "clarity," "important" and "valuable" mean at any given time. 
- I don't believe that anyone can control every outcome, nor that success can be guaranteed.

### How I communicate
- Circularly. I am often sounding things out to myself at the same time as you, and may seem to always be in a state of throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. 
- With that said, I am neither precious or petty about ideas and I value people speaking up, interupting, involving themselves and telling me what they think I need to know. 
- I usually prefer a quick decision and have a bias for action.
- I prefer people coming to their own decisions/solutions and then letting me know how I can help (as opposed to asking for permission or direction). I believe in you! 
- I personally place a lot of importance on how the story of our team is told/sold to other teams and users. I place a lot of value in how things feel as much as how they are. 

### What I value

- Reflection
- Trust
- Intentions
- Empathy
- Fearlessness

### My assumptions

### My availability
- I am available to you whenever you need me, though I do ask that you try your best to utilize the time we have already scheduled together. With that said, During business hours I will respond to any message that comes to me same day, usually same hour when feasible. 
- While this includes after hours, please assume that I'm not always readily available after hours and my response time may be based on my perception of your urgency. If it's urgent, please let me know! 
- Lastly, keep in mind that I'm usually pretty busy, both at work and at home, and a phone call may not always be the best way to connect with me. A text or Slack will always be preferred over a call, especially after hours. However, if urgent, please call. With that said though, I must prefer talking to texting, and so when I get your message, I may ask to call you. 

### How I can help you
- My role on any given team is usually comprised of two roles: leader and assistant. The value I add is by staying ahead on the big picture while shoring up the details behind the team. 
- I excel at listening, coaching, dot-connecting and finding the (maybe) hidden value or lesson in something you were doing or have just done.
- I am good at laying out the vision, the path and then cheering you on, and am trying to get better at on-the-spot feedback. 
- I am helping with providing feedback after an event, including debriefing and talking about what to do next
- I am great at helping parse out vague, unclear or opaque things, and am equally great at supporting in highly urgent or volatile situations.

### How I might annoy or confuse you
- I am an absolute optimist. I don't believe any wall is too high and I operate from the position that *my* team can do absolutely anything they set their minds to. 
- I typically set ambitious goals. You may think I'm being over-ambitious and that's completely fine. 
- When making a decision, I tend to prefer how things feel to data, but still believe that data is extremely important. Conversely, when taking input and feedback, I tend to prefer facts first over feelings. 
- I can sometimes seem direct and stubbon. I don't mean to be, but this is sometimes the outcome of my bias toward action. If you feel I've crossed a line at any time, I'm relying on you to let me know!
