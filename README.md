### What is this all about?

- Just like any `README` file, this is an easy way to answer questions that you may have regarding how I work and collaborate with you. 
- Having a document like this helps me clarify my ideas and values and communicate them. 
- Having a document like this also allows any collaborator, partner or team member that I work with to hold me to my own standards in a safe and non-confrontational way.
- Keep in mind though, I'm a human, and some of this may change as I grow and develop myself.

### How I view success
- I believe learning agility is essential to success and that success is an output of how well someone can duck-and-dive in opaque or unclear situations.
- There are three important levers for success in a leadership role: People, Purpose and Process. 
- Therefore, success is having the right people in the right roles working with clarity on important and valuable things in the right way, while defining, measuring and adjusting what "right," "clarity," "important" and "valuable" mean at any given time. 
- I don't believe that anyone can control every outcome, nor that success can be guaranteed.

### How I communicate
- Circularly. I am often sounding things out to myself at the same time as you, and may seem to always be in a state of throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. 
- With that said, I am neither precious or petty about ideas and I value people speaking up, interupting, involving themselves and telling me what they think I need to know. 
- I usually prefer a quick decision and have a bias for action.
- I prefer people coming to their own decisions/solutions and then letting me know how I can help (as opposed to asking for permission or direction). I believe in you! 
- I personally place a lot of importance on how the story of our team is told/sold to other teams and users. I place a lot of value in how things feel as much as how they are.

### My assumptions

### How I can help you
- My role on any given team is usually comprised of two roles: visionary and assistant. 

### How I might annoy or confuse you
- I am an absolute optimist. I don't believe any wall is too high and I operate from the position that *my* team can do absolutely anything they set their minds to. 
- I typically set ambitious goals.
- I typically prefer how things feel to data, but still believe that data is extremely important.
